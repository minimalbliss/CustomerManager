Please make sure to have the api project and ui project startup at the same time

It may well ask you to install the certifcates on localhost...

https://localhost:7045/index.html for the swagger to use the api directly

https://localhost:7253/ for my terrible first attempt at a blazor pages project.

hopefully the db will be available for you to use. If not, please use Update-Database command in the Package Manager Console to create the database.

Two consoles will open , one for the api and one for the ui. The urls will be posted in there. I've also been playing around with open telementry and have added this to the conole views.
